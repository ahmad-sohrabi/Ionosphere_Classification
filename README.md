# Ionosphere Dataset Classification
In This Project, We have analyzed different hyperparameters of neural networks and preprocessing techniques to see their effect on Accuracy, Loss, Precision, Recall and F-Score.
<br />
The whole process is done on Ionosphere Dataset.
<br />
For neural network programming, [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework is used.
